# Assignment

## Instructions

Complete the following exercises using Python.

1. Linear Regression Exercise:
   Using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn, create a linear regression model to predict house prices.
   Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression on test set.

   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

   # Load dataset
   housing = fetch_california_housing()
   ```

2. Classification Exercise:
   Using the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn, build classification models to predict malignant vs benign tumors.
   Compare Logistic Regression and KNN performance on test set.

   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

   # Load dataset
   cancer = load_breast_cancer()
   ```
